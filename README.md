# Welcome to the Falnama project


<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

In the fall of 2024 our small research team started to investigate the
*Falnama* (Persian) manuscript that is hold by the Wereldmuseum
Rotterdam. This beautiful manuscript consists of 35 loose pages and
brings many questions to the table. To get an impression see three of
the pages below.

What are the stories of these pages? On this website we want to showcase
this fascinating manuscript and highlight some of the hidden traces that
evidence its origins and history.

We also want to enable you to take a look into our ‘research kitchen’.
On which data do we base our findings? And how did we process this data?
If you are interested into data science you can find the Python code
that we developed to make this work in the second part of this website.
