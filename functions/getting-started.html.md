# Getting started with Python


<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

n order to make full use of the `falnama-dev` Python package, you need
to be able to install Python packages and run Python code in Jupyter
notebooks on your computer. The quickest and easiest way to get started
with Jupyter notebooks is by downloading and installing the JupyterLab
Desktop (JLD) installer for your operating system from the [official
github
repository](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-desktop#installation).

::: {.callout-note} The first time you start JupyterLab Desktop you
additionally need to install the default Python environment from the
start menu. To do so you need to hoover and click on the word ‘install’
on the bottom of the start up screen.

:::

Finally you can install or update (with the `-U` option) the
`falnama-dev` package directly from this github repository. This is done
by executing this command from a code cell in a Jupyter notebook:

    %pip install git+https://github.com/fligt/falnama-dev 

For more information about Jupyterlab Desktop see the [JLD user
guide](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-desktop/blob/master/user-guide.md)

**That is it! You are now ready to explore the Falnama data together
